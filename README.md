# MediminderDoctorVersionPrototype
Prototype for doctor version of mediminder app for Dr. Bullard's Principles of Software Engineering class

Hey guys, so first Rafael will build the UI for this, then I will write the necessary activity classes 
and hook them up to the UI, then Santiago will write the business logic. It will be more clear as we go along,
let's just start with Rafael doing the UI.

To clone this repo first make sure you have git installed, then
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/mddrill/MediminderDoctorVersionPrototype/
```

This will clone this project to your home directory.
Next download Android Studio and open this project, then do your part.

When you done doing your part do
```
git add .
git commit -m "did Matts part"
git push origin master
```
Obviously, write your name instead of Matt

That will update this github repo with the changes you made

Don't hesistate to ask me questions if this isn't clear enough.
